# cnc_panel
basic control over raspberry pico w cnc tool - currently electrical discharge machine (edm).

gcode compatible. i added my own functionality - 'sculpt' and 'drill image'; they need revision because of an 'if' commands which work not really good now.

private project, but still open source. maybe someone will find sth usefull here
